This was my first Game Jam and it was quite an experience - I arrived way ahead of time for registration and watched as people brought in desktops, multiple screens, food and onesies. This made me feel quite unprepared as I only had a laptop, money and sleeping bag :sweat_smile:

This was the [keynote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVl8o85YGNE) and the [theme announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1W5VxdNyNk).\
I got paired up with a fellow student, an artist and two other programmers, and the clock started ticking. First, we brainstormed over the theme "What will you do?" and after ten minutes or so, we settled on the idea that the player controls a person falling from a plane, trying to grab stuff to slow him down so he would survive. 

It was the first time ever being at an event like this and I was surrounded by people graduated, working professionally and going to this event for fun so I stated my skills - little bit of GameMaker, Unity and C#, Blender, and Java, and tried to help out as much as I could. I ended up not doing very much and eventually sat and watched how a team works together to build a game. 

We called the finished game "Splat" and uploaded the game onto the [Global Game Jam site](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/splat-0) for people to play. Unfortunately now the game has been taken down from the website and we're only left with the source files. I'll see if I can recreate the game with the source files though!
