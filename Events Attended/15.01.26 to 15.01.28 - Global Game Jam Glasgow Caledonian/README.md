This was my first Game Jam and it was quite an experience - I arrived ahead of registration time and watched as people brought in desktops, multiple screens, food and onesies. This made me feel quite unprepared as I only had a laptop, money and sleeping bag :sweat_smile:

This was the [keynote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVl8o85YGNE) and the [theme announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1W5VxdNyNk).\
The theme was "What will you do?" and after brainstorming, my team came up with the idea of controlling a falling person from a plane and try surviving. 

It was the first time ever being at an event like this and I was surrounded by people graduated, working professionally and going to this event for fun so I stated my skills - little bit of GameMaker, Unity and C#, Blender, and Java, and tried to help out as much as I could. I ended up not doing very much and eventually sat and watched how a team worked together to build a game. 

We called the finished game "Splat" and uploaded the game onto the [Global Game Jam site](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/splat-0) for people to play. Unfortunately now the game has been taken down from the website and we're only left with the source files. I'll see if I can recreate the game with the source files though!
