The 2nd Game Jam I signed up for was hosted at The University of the West of Scotland with the [Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE) and the UWS Games Development Society](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sie-uws-gds-game-jam-tickets-15718480398). When I signed up for it, I didn't realise it conflicted with Chinese New Year so when I arrived a halfway through the event, I had already organised a team with a couple of my friends and agreed that I would help them when I came back. 

The theme was "Out of Time" and my team had created the beginnings of a board game. It was simplistic very different to my last Game Jam - instead of programming and animation, they instead created a board and cards out of paper and when I came back, I helped refine the rules and the creation of cards to create the "Native Pixel Wars" board game. Our final product was very flimsy and easily crushed thus left in the care of my teammate and a week later, I found out our team had won the "Best Innovation" award.
