## Notes:

Igda.org - International games developers association\
Games take ~ 2 years to build\
Be careful of the game development life cycle (check on wiki)\
Build for the future\
Console have shelf life of 10 years\
Make predictions for the game you're building at the present for the future

Look at the trends\
Identity trends that you have no control over\
Choose a few for timeframe\
Make predictions\
Always check if right

Hardware industry dominated by mobiles\
Low power/cost\
Compute and storage\
GPU outlier

Neurogaming\
Natural input\
Virtual Reality or and Augmented Reality\
AI - emotion\
Like, guy here is swearing lot, let's reduce difficulty

Types of gamers\
Price (in)sensitive - (best graphics and hardware) performance for price\
Mobile game - social, casual, innovative. Not willing to pay much\
AAA games\
TripleA industry\
All about money\
Take a risk to lower cost

2 types of games\
Small and cheap - mobile\
Large and expensive - lots of money spent before game is actually made. E.g gta5

Middle gap so maybe adjust programming for art? So art's going to be cheaper and quicker with pre-designed art

Satalite for communication? Less delay between input\
May happen 2020\
Game risk = movie risk\
Development tools move to cloud\
Tune after shipping\
End of DRM - piracy proof\
Rethink of the end device we use

American idol. Made it able to vote - interact. But if record to skip adverts, can't vote

Hardware prices will go down\
More communication than ever\
Collect data as you go

All predictions involve risk\
Don't have too many predictions\
Since PC gets stronger, console life cycle may get shorter?\
New class of device may show up\
Or console price build will become cheaper\
Gamers have lots of disabled people

Are you targeting money or market?\
Most companies go for money\
Don't jump on trends too early\
On console.  90% people stay on first screen\
High performance code can't really run on unity\
Video games can copy tabletop games: being able to make your own story\
Lots of games at the moment is run and shoot\
Try and incoperate story telling
