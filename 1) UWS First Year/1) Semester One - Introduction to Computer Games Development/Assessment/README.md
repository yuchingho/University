# Introduction to Computer Games Development Assessment

Assessment.pdf gives the outline of the submission:
- A Game Design Document

One of Lab03 was chosen to help with the the final assessment, and I chose "Creating Maze Games".\
Audio and Images Folders contain the assets used to build LoL_Maze.gm81 file.\
LoL_Maze.gm81 shows how the game was programmed.\
LoL_Maze.exe is the file to play the game.
