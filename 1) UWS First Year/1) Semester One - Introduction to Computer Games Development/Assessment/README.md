The Maze of League of Legends was created to help completely new League players ease into the game. It is a complex game, so a maze game with easy controls will show how the game can feel like by using allies, enemies, and objectives.

CD Cover - Not well cut so lost marks for presentation\
Game - There was implemented sound, a menu system, tutorials, 4 levels and intricate story, time system and it was of relatively professional quality. It was a glorified maze game however and some students had submitted a more difficult implementation. So the marks had to be adjusted accordingly for the entire cohort.
