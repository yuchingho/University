Design for Interaction focused on using Adobe Flash Pro, learning its language "ActionScript", the importance of Graphical User Interfaces, User Interaction, and User Experience.

There were two assessments:
1) The first assessment was selecting three labs out of Weeks 3 to 9. For my submission, I chose Lab03, Lab04 and Lab08.

2) In the Assessment's folder, the second assessment was to build an information map for a Cruise Ship.
