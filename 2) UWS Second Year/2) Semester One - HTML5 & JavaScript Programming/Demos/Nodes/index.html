    <h1>Node.js Demo Apps</h1>
    <p>This page links to a number of demos which use Node.js as a "mini server".  Each of the pages listed below
       is set up as a file that can be executed by the Node.js server.  To serve any of them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Download/install the Node.js application at <a href="http://node.js.org">node.js.org</a></li>
        <li>Execute the Node.js application in a Command window (or Terminal on OS-X), passing one of the sample
            files as a parameter.  You may need to enter the whole path to the program to run it:
            e.g C:\Program Files\Node\Node.js hello.js</li>
        <li>Open a browser at http://localhost:[port-number] to see the page in your browser (replace [port-number]
            with the number passed as a parameter to the http.createServer() function - e..g 8888).  Ports for
            each demo are listed below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following demos are in this folder:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HelloServer.js (port 8888) - simply responds to every request with "Hello World!".</li>
        <li>HelloDOMServer.js (port 8889) - replies with a full web page - still always "Hello World".</li>
        <li>NodeCalculator.js (port 8080) - this serves a simple HTML form with input fields.  If you press the submit
            button, node will print out the input fields button on the terminal window.  It is a simple demo of how
            to get form data.  If you want a calculator, finish it!</li>
        <li>WriteFile.js (port 8890) - writes a file to the same folder the script file is in.  Demonstrates file
            operations.</li>
        <li>httpServer.js (port 9090) - this is a complete web server that can serve html, css, js, gif, png and jpg
            files.  Enough to cover everything you would do in your project.  Try running the server and then browsing
            to any of the HTML files in the folder (index.html [this one], geo-location.html, Lab1.html).</li>
        <li>args.js (port 8890) - lists the arguments passed to the page- e.g if you start up the server with the
            command: >Node args.js one two three - the server will list the three arguments (one two three) on the
            terminal window.  This is very useful for configuring an app at run-time - e.g. passing in the name of the
            folder that contains image files.</li>
    </ul>
