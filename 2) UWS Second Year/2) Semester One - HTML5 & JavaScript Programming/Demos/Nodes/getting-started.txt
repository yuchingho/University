Getting Started:
================

Download and install Node.js from http://nodejs.org.
In a command window, move to the folder you unzipped this file into.
Run Node.js followed by the JS file you wish to execute.  For example
C:>Node HelloServer.js
will run the simple web server script.
Open a browser and point it to the port number given at the end of the 
JS file you are executing - e.g. http://localhost:8888 (for HelloServer.js)

Browser through the rest of the scripts.  For a workable web server, execute:

C:>Node httpSeerver.js

And point the browser at this domain with a web file name at the end, e.g.

http://localhost:9090/index.html
