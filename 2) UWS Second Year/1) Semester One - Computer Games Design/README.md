Computer Games Design was the first module since starting that gave an insight to how a game company would work. The lecturer started off by playing the video [So You Want To Be a Game Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQvWMdWhFCc) and to me - the video clarified what it meant a Game Developer was and inspired and reaffirmed my thoughts of becoming a developer.

The assessment was a two-fold project:
1. Come up with an idea, write a design document, business report and pitch.
2. Record a blog with [Wordpress](https://thoughtsgamedev.wordpress.com/) on how the idea started and developed.

Sample design documents were given out as examples and guidelines.
