## Assessment

From my [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aop7ymLBugIggge8X_gd5pCYpIJ3) -
- BlenderRoom02 Folder contains Blender files for the models in Room02 
- BlenderRoom03 Folder contains Blender files for the models in Room03
- AnimationJam is a Photoshop file
- Rooms.zip is the Unreal Project
    - _Rooms-EXE-Windows Folder contains the executable file, or play on Itch

## Assessment01 - Audacity, Adobe Photoshop CS6, and Adobe Premiere Pro CS6
The assessment was about an upcoming Animation Jam and split into two parts:
1) Making a Poster - Animation Jam.png
2) [Making a Video](https://youtu.be/NspRm2WFxl4)

## Assessment02 - Unreal Game Engine
This was making a three-part room with Unreal and put into:
1) Room 1 (start): should be the starting point of the level, and should be empty of all objects other than a light source of some description (for example, a point light, spot light or emissive glow from a wall surface).

2) Room 2 (textured object): must contain an imported 3D static mesh asset, which can be a geometric primitive (such as a cube) or something more complex. It must incorporate at least three different materials you have designed yourself, each of which must include a texture created in Photoshop and imported into Unreal.

3) Room 3 (“freestyle”): must include a different asset from that in Room 2. This asset must have some more complex aspect to it: it could be an animated skeletal mesh, a static mesh using some complex material setup (for example, an animated glow effect), or a Blueprint such as a triggerable light. You are encouraged to research different possibilities and come up with something that goes beyond the tutorial exercises.

Your project must incorporate an imported audio asset in some way. Examples of this might include a sound that plays when the level starts up, a sound used as part of the Room 3 asset, or as a continually looping sound (preferably not too annoying!).
