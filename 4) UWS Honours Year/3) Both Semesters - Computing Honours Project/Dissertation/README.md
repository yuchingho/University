Atomic Attack is my Final Year Serious Game project inspired by “Defend Your Castle (2008)”, developed to teach players about the first 18 elements of the Periodic Table and its real-life applications.

The game is an endless Anti-Tower Defense Serious Game and the objective is to destroy the Enemy Castle as fast as possible. The Blue Units will be continiously spawning and defending against the player’s Red Units. The player will act as a general commander – buying upgrades for Red Units inspired by the Periodic Table, and interacting with Blue Units by throwing them about.

Research was undertaken after the game was developed and my dissertation goes into more detail.
