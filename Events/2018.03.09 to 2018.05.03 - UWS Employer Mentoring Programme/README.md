The UWS Employer Mentoring Programme allowed students to sign up and be paired with a person with a relevant industry to their course. Logs had to be taken at each meeting to summarise what was learnt and helped with.

I was paired with a person from Morgan Stanley and each meeting raised my confidence and lowered my anxiety about entering into the world of work. Even though I was viewing a different industry, it was extremely insightful to how Morgan Stanley's development sector worked and further affirmed my desire to enter the Games Development Industry.
