## 2015 UWS Animation Jam

The [UWS Animation Jam](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/uws-animation-and-game-jam-tickets-16690988195) event's theme was "communication". Different animatic parts were split between the other members and my role was to research on the history of humanity's communcation, get image and audio references, and work on background ideas with a team-member.

Made in 2015, 1st Year, Bonds is an animatic showing the history of how people communicated with each other; and by making humanity more connected, we also made ourselves more isolated.
