## SAUWS Volunteer Free Shop

I became more involved with university by volunteering at a new university initiative - the SAUWS Free Shop, in addition to becoming a Student Guide and Student Fellowship member.

Student Association UWS Free Shop was where students could drop off unwanted items and or take items in an exchange shop run by university volunteers. It's a great idea since UWS receives a lot of Erasmus Students, they can use items like cutlery, duvets, pillows for the year instead of buying it and then leaving them behind.

To volunteer for this position, I wrote a Cover Letter, kept an Activity Log and reviewed the growth of my skills and at the end, I received an award for my time there.
