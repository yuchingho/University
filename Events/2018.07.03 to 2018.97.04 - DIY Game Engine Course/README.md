## DIY Game Engine Course

The DIY Game Engine Course was run by [Dr. Andreas Stiegler](https://www.edx.org/bio/andreas-stiegler) who took a small group of us and built a Game Engine based off our ideas. This was extremely helpful to me as I learnt the inner workings of how engines like Unity and Unreal worked.

The description of it is below:
> Ever wondered how Games work from a technical point of view? Ever wondered how Engines like Unreal and Unity tick? Games are among the most complex pieces of software you can develop, and we'll approach the heart of many games: the mysterious "Game Engine". 

> In this little course, we'll dig deep and write the foundation of our own small game Engine through 2 days. Doing so, you'll learn a lot about the internals of game objects, what component models are and why they are useful, how spatial containers work and much more. We are also open for detours into specific coding topics depending on your interest!

> In the course, we will develop a small game engine together. That is, we do the thinking, I write the code. Thus, you don't have to bring your own devices (you are free to, though, of course!). The course is open for everybody, and you don't need in-depth coding experience to attend.
