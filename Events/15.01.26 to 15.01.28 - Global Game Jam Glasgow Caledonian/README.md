This was my first Game Jam and it was quite an experience - I arrived ahead of registration time and watched as people brought in desktops, multiple screens, food and onesies. This made me feel quite unprepared as I only had a laptop, money and sleeping bag :sweat_smile:

This was the [keynote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVl8o85YGNE) and the [theme announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1W5VxdNyNk).\
The theme was "What will you do?" and after brainstorming, my team came up with the idea of controlling a falling person from a plane and try surviving. 

We called the finished game "Splat" and uploaded the game onto the [Global Game Jam site](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/splat-0) for people to play. To play this short game, download this project, navigate to the SplatUnity Folder and open Splat.exe
