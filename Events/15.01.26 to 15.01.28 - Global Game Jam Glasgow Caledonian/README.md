Splat is a game where you are falling from a plane and you try to control yourself to grab the parachute. The indicator points to where parachute is and your goal is to not be hit by the falling objects - as they can rip off your limbs - and grab the parachute to land safely.

The [keynote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVl8o85YGNE) and theme "[ What do we do now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1W5VxdNyNk)" were presented and after brainstorming, our group came up with the idea of controlling a falling person from a plane and try surviving.
