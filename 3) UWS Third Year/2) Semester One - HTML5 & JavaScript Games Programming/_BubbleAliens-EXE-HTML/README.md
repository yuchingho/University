Bubble Aliens is a short serious game developed with a HTML5 Game Framework - Phaser, designed to teach people about hydrocarbons, cracking and fractionational distillation and their uses. The gameplay is simple - defeat the ALIEN! However the player wants to win is up to them, and through repetitive gameplay the player will learn what each hydrocarbon can be used for. A game design document is embedded into the project with all the information sourced.

I came up with this idea because back in high school, I was struggling to learn Chemistry. I searched around for games that were fun and would teach me as well. None were to my expectations and when I wrote my university personal statement, my dream game came to me: an open world where the player would learn Chemistry to a high-school level.

In my imagined final version, the player will be taken into story-mode and progress whilst learning Chemistry and being able to compete/work together with other players to rule or create. To begin this massive project, I will be breaking the game down into lots of different parts: miniature games inside a big game.

Some Phaser Example Sprites were used or created through Piskel, Photoshop. The map created with Tiled and the background music was taken from Phaser Example Bodenstaendig_2000. Other audio files were downloaded from [soundbible](http://soundbible.com) or created myself and edited with Audacity. 

The game is not perfect: collision handling sometimes messes up, text sprites aren't destroyed correctly, sounds overlap, and a major bug of which bubbles don't reset correctly until it's been popped again and thus the same unit can spawn multiple times... but it's to the best of my current ability with Phaser. One of the ways I could improve it is by adding states following these tutorials: [one](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2014/08/28/phaser-tutorial-understanding-phaser-states/), [two](https://jsfiddle.net/lewster32/vd70o41p/) and [three](http://filmsbykris.com/scripts/Awesome-Game/).

An editor like [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads/edit) or using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is required to open the project and play the game via the "index.html" file.

This project is in association with my 3rd Year Module <a href="https://github.com/yuchingho/university/tree/master/3)%20UWS%20Third%20Year/2)%20Semester%20One%20-%20HTML5%20%26%20JavaScript%20Games%20Programming">HTML5 & JavaScript Games Programming</a>.

I received 91/100, A1 - Lecturer's comments:
> Simple game design. Perhaps it is better to have a main page which introduce the game and a separate game page to host the game. The overview of the game is included. More details on the research would be beneficial, comprehensive design document.
>
> Very creative idea. The fact that it looks like a engineering management game but it is actually an arcade game (every element contributed to the army which is spawn on the 'battlefield' on the right hand side of the screen) makes the game interesting. There are some collission bugs on the bubble.
>
> A menu including the instructions are implemented at the start of the game. The assets are fairly basic but it is clear and relevant. The spawned objects on the battlefield looks good (and funny) too.
