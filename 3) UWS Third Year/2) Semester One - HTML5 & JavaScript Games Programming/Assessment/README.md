Made in 2017, Bubble Aliens is a short serious game designed to teach people about hydrocarbons, cracking and fractional distillation and their uses. Through repetitive gameplay the player will learn what each hydrocarbon can be used for. 

The game is endless, competing to get the highest score. There are several bugs - collision handling sometimes messes up, text sprites aren't destroyed correctly, sounds overlap, and a major bug of which bubbles don't reset correctly until it's been popped again and thus the same unit can spawn multiple times.

## Assessment
Some Phaser Example Sprites were used or created through Piskel, Photoshop. The map created with Tiled and the background music was taken from Phaser Example Bodenstaendig_2000. Other audio files were downloaded from [SoundBible](http://soundbible.com) or created myself and edited with Audacity. 

If downloaded, an editor like [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads/edit) or using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is required to open the project and play the game via the "index.html" file.

## Marks Breakdown
I received 91/100, A1 - Lecturer's comments:
> Simple game design. Perhaps it is better to have a main page which introduce the game and a separate game page to host the game. The overview of the game is included. More details on the research would be beneficial, comprehensive design document.
>
> Very creative idea. The fact that it looks like a engineering management game but it is actually an arcade game (every element contributed to the army which is spawn on the 'battlefield' on the right hand side of the screen) makes the game interesting. There are some collission bugs on the bubble.
>
> A menu including the instructions are implemented at the start of the game. The assets are fairly basic but it is clear and relevant. The spawned objects on the battlefield looks good (and funny) too.
