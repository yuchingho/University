Creative Technology Professionalism focused on being professional in the Creative Industries, creating and increasing your portfolio with content and networking through guest speakers and LinkedIn.

There were two assessments:
1. Blog.pdf - I originally embedded this on my Neocities website but transferred it over to [Wordpress](https://creativetechnologyprofessionalism.wordpress.com/).
2. Technical Report.pdf - There were a number of topics to choose from and I chose the "Evaluation of Game Engine Platforms for the Purposes of 2D and 3D Game Design"
