My research participants will have two requirements – be open-minded and try and have fun, and not have any extensive knowledge of the subject area I am testing. 

I can have three groups: a group learning from the video game, a group learning from a text-book, and a group learning from a video lecture. I can then give them a week to complete the game/learn the subject area and afterwards give them all the same short test to see how much knowledge was learnt.

There are many variables I cannot control – like how long the person takes to play the game/study, if the person enjoys the game, if the person enjoys learning from studying more than playing a game or vice versa and how my game is more likely geared towards the male population.
