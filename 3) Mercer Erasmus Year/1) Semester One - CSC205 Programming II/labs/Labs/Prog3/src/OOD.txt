This project is a database where the manager can enter in new Employee's names and wages. The manager can select 
if the person is getting paid hourly or annually; afterwards the manager can calculate their paychecks by entering 
in individually how many hours they worked, raise all their wages at once and download what he has put in in an 
employee.dat file and upload that file once the system has quit.
