myLibrary will ask the user to enter in the correct file name: library.dat; if the user does not enter in the 
correct file name, a catch IOException error message will be displayed.
A menu will then pop up, asking the user to select between 3 choices: "Display all book records", "Search for a 
book by its title" or "Exit Search Program".
Choice One will display the first book, and will cycle through the library.dat with each enter key, and the user
can press "m" to exit and be taken back to the menu.
Choice Two will search and display one book then exit back to the menu.
Choice Three will terminate the program.
