Beginning Acting was split into two:\
First half - Acting in Theatre\
Second half - Acting in Film

Both gave me a fasinating insight into the acting world and has raised my respect for this profession immensely. Over the course of the semester, assignments were given out:
1. Act out a short part (myself as Flynn)
2. Watch eleven 10-minute plays performed by Mercer students and write a report
3. Watch August: Osage County performed by Mercer students and write a report
4. Volunteer at a food bank

The Scenes pdfs were given out as guidelines, like how "Contentless Scenes" and "Bread" can be interpreted so differently by injecting emotion. "Inside your Character", "Emotional Beats" and reading the book [Audition: Everything an Actor Needs to Know to Get the Part by Michael Shurtleff](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Audition.html?id=fpgBxuScPEsC&redir_esc=y) explained the core concepts.

In the second half, I learnt basic stage fighting and how camera angles and "reacting" to your partner trick the audience into believing the action; heard interesting stories about [Screen Actors Guild](https://www.sagaftra.org/) and [Voicebunny](https://voicebunny.com/) and learnt 10 valuable lessons for live video interviews:
1. Have diffuse lights pointing towards you as it would be in a professional photoshoot. This means there won't be any shadow on your face; and if you can't find strong diffuse light, use natural sunlight.

2. Stand if needed, to have the camera placed at a height where your head, neck, shoulders and bit of chest should fill the screen from top to bottom, like a headshot.

3. Have a solid background - preferably light grey.\
Don't show backgrounds of where viewers can see your room, dirty laundry, etc.
4. Have a solid colour shirt that is opposite colour of the background, not the colour white though!
5. Make your voice and movements slow and controlled - especially your blinking and eye movements - unless the scene calls for emotion.
6. Don't blink too much.
7. Really, really immerse yourself into the character.\
If you don't believe you are the character, then the viewers won't believe you. If you watch interviews of actors and actresses, notice how they say something along the lines of "I'm not that type of person, but my character would...
8. Smile (showing off teeth) for the thumbnail and for a relaxing sight at the start and end of the video.
9. Say your name at the start of the video and at the end of the video!\
It's easy to forget from nervousness but you want to reminder the viewer who you are; and if you're shooting for a big role, this video could quite literally change your life.
10. Finally, do something that will make you stand out from the crowd!\
Following rules and instructions get you far, but showcase your talent!\
