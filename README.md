This repository will contain lectures, lab work and projects from when I entered the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) to when I graduate.

In January 2017 I wanted to create my own website with [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), though in December 2017 I started using Github and  and decided to transfer my site over. This repository will not be finished until all tasks are ticked and when I have graduated.
